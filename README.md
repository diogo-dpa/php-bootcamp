# PHP Bootcamp

Learning project for PHP.

## How to run

### Level 1

```bash
cd level-1
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Bookwise

```bash
cd bookwise
php -S localhost:8000
```

Access `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## About the server

The `-S` flag activates PHP's built-in web server. It's required because PHP needs a web server to process `.php` files and serve dynamic content, unlike static HTML files that can be opened directly in the browser.
